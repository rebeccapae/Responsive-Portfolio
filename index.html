                Hi and welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Rebecca Pae and I aspire to create innovative applications and tools that enhance people's lives, focusing on finance. With an accounting background, I spent 4 years working in the finance and tax departments. My coding journey starts now. so that I can utlize the valuble financial experiences I've gained to make creative, innovative, and tangible solutions to the various financial problems people face today.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When I'm not coding I love to dance and take hip-hop/KPOP classes, and bake. I've performed several KPOP cover dances and enjoy watching dance videos in my spare time. In addition to dancing, I have a big passion for baking cakes and small desserts. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I've lived in many different places including the U.S (Wisconsin, Ohio, Washington, California), Canada (Vancouver, Ontario), and South Korea. My favorite place so far is Seattle, Washington, where I attended the University of Washingon.
